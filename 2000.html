      <p id="para20"> What was fashion like in the early 2000's? 2000's fashion took much inspiration from
	1960's bohemian looks, which consisted of yoga pants, low-rise jeans, baggy pants, cowl-neck shirt, flared pants,
	cropped jackets, crop tops, baby tees, and mini skirts. Along with the accessorization, of jeweled
	baker boy caps, belts, baguette bags, and some shiny jewelry, 2000's fashion was glamorous. It is often seen
	as an era of a global mash up, in which trends experienced the fusion of previous vintage styles,
	as well as the collaboration of global and ethnic clothing. Here in this picture, we can see one of 2000's fashion
	icons, Paris Hilton. She usually set the standard for fashion trends. Here we can see her wearing one of her
	iconic graphic tees with a mini skirt, and bright pink baguette bag.</p>

	<p id="para20"> Much like the 90s, fashion 
	in the early 2000's included trends such as low 
	rise jeans and cargo pants, with graphic tees and chunky 
	sneakers. While low rise jeans first became popular in the 
	late 90's, they really took off.   </p>
